GitHub repo (todo-app): https://github.com/brianabauman/csc436-hw4-todo-app

Instructons:

For todo-app:
$ http-server dist/todo-app

For first-firebase-app
$ http-server first-firebase-app-dist/first-firebase-app

Notes:
- I tried to do both extra credits
- I had trouble with some styling, I hope you aren't too critical!
- I chose to use an Observable rather than a list of todos. This is how the "First Firebase App" worked, and it seemed to jibe with what we discussed in class. I hope this is OK.
