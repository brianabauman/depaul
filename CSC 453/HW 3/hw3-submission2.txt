Q3

c) From previous assignment:

ID -> First, Last, Salary
First, Last -> ID
Last -> Team
Salary -> Dept

R1(ID, First, Last, Salary)
R2(Last, Team)
R3(Salary, Dept)

This relation is also in BCNF because each functional dependency consists of a superkey (for the given relations) on the left hand side.

Q5

a) R(ABCD), F = { BC->A, AD->C, CD->B, BD->C) }

This relation is not in BCNF because BC is not a superkey for this relation.

b) R(ABCD), F = { BD->C, AB->D, AC->B, BD->A }

This relation is in BCNF because the left side of each functional dependency is a superkey for the relation.

c) R(ABCD), F = { A->C, B->A, A->D, AD->C }

This relation is not in BCNF because A is not a superkey for this relation.

Q6

R(ABCDE), F = { A->BC, BC->A, D->E, C->DE }, candidate keys: A, BC

This relation is not even in 2NF, because a functional dependency (C->DE) relies on a proper subset (C) of a candidate key (BC). Therefore, it is not in 3NF or BCNF either.

To decompose into BCNF, we'll use the strategy from class. The first violating functional dependency is D->E. We correct by splitting the relation into two:

R1(DE), R2(ABCD)

Next, we have the functional dependency C->D that needs to be taken care of:

R1(DE), R2(CD), R3(ABC)

This relationship is now in BCNF, but is not dependency preserving (the dependency C->DE is lost).
